# Notes of Bioinformatics in Action  by Shisu Li 2023
## Plan
### 1.Learn to programme by Linux
### 2.Master the basic techniques of bioinformatics
### 3.Building a framework for bioinformatics learning and practice
## Notes
### Lecture 1
- Gene
  - coding
  - non-coding
*Why do humans have so few genes?*
**science & technology(RNG)**
- Method
  - Sequencing:Nanopore, Single Molecule Real-time, etc.
  - Computing
- 3 steps of Bioinformatics
  - Information:images,sequences;
  - Model:the representations or structures that capture the underlying patterns or relationships in data
  - Algorithm:the instructions or rules that define how to solve a problem
- Two types of Bioinformatics studies:
  - Data Problems
  - Biology Problems
